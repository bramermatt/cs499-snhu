            <h1>1. Professional Self-Assessment</h1>
            <p>Completing my coursework throughout the Computer Science program at SNHU and developing my ePortfolio has been instrumental in highlighting my strengths, shaping my professional goals and values, and preparing me to enter the field of computer science. The structured learning approach provided by the program allowed me to delve deeply into various aspects of computer science, from fundamental concepts to advanced applications. My ePortfolio showcases a diverse range of projects and artifacts that demonstrate my proficiency in algorithms, data structures, software engineering, databases, and security. These experiences have not only enhanced my technical skills but also solidified my commitment to continuous learning and professional growth.</p>
                
            <p>One of the key strengths I have developed is the ability to collaborate effectively in a team environment. Throughout the program, I participated in numerous group projects that required coordinating with team members, dividing tasks, and integrating different components into a cohesive final product. For instance, in a software engineering course, my team developed a comprehensive project management tool that required seamless collaboration and communication. This experience taught me the importance of teamwork, adaptability, and effective communication. Additionally, my role often involved liaising with stakeholders to gather requirements and provide updates, further honing my ability to convey technical information clearly and concisely.</p>
                
            <p>In terms of technical skills, my ePortfolio demonstrates a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms, software engineering, database management, and security. For example, my Binary Search Tree project exemplifies my ability to implement and optimize data structures, showcasing my problem-solving abilities and attention to detail. My work on developing a secure file transfer application highlights my understanding of security principles and my ability to apply them in practical scenarios. Each artifact in my portfolio is a testament to my technical expertise and dedication to producing high-quality work. Together, these artifacts present a comprehensive overview of my capabilities, illustrating my readiness to tackle complex challenges in the field of computer science.</p>
                
            <p>In summary, my professional self-assessment underscores the range of skills and experiences that I bring to the table. From collaborating in team environments and communicating with stakeholders to mastering data structures, algorithms, software engineering, databases, and security, my journey through the Computer Science program has been both enriching and transformative. The artifacts in my ePortfolio not only reflect my technical proficiency but also my commitment to excellence and continuous improvement. I am confident that the knowledge and skills I have gained will make me a valuable asset in any computer science role, and I look forward to contributing to innovative and impactful projects in the future.</p>

            <h1>2. Code Review</h1>
            <p>For the first milestone assignment in CS 499, you will complete a code review of the work you identified for enhancement in the ePortfolio selection and enhancement assignment you completed in Module One. In Milestone One, you will describe and critically analyze your existing code and discuss your plans for enhancement in detail. Completing this assignment will give you a strong foundation for the enhancements you will complete in CS 499. The milestone will highlight areas for improvement as you work on your enhancements. You will specifically highlight what skills you plan to demonstrate and align the enhancements to course outcomes for each of the three categories.</p>
